Here are data, codes and resulting pictures of my master thesis: **Integrative Cross-Disease Profiling of the Human Blood N-Glycome Using Data Re-analysis**

We integrated complementary approches —— univariate effect size comparisons, multivariate dimensionality reduction techniques, and network-based approaches. Codes are stored in the 'code' folder.

We also applied this workflow to 13 published datasets comprising approximately 7,000 samples (see 'data'). The resulting pictures are stored in the 'Results' folder.
